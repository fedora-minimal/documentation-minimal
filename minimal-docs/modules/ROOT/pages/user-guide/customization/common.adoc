== Partitioning

By default *Fedora Minimal* uses raw partitioning with an `ext4` root partition mounted at `/`. This can be changed in the following ways:

=== Mode

More information about how `image-builder` uses partitioning mode customizations can be found in the https://osbuild.org/docs/user-guide/partitioning/[upstream documentation].

==== btrfs

To build an image that uses btrfs you can use the following blueprint:

[source,toml]
----
[[customizations.disk.partitions]]
type = "btrfs"
minsize = "1 GiB"
subvolumes = [
  { name = "root", mountpoint = "/" },
]
----

This will convert the partition that contains the root mountpoint `/` to a btrfs volume containing a root subvolume.

==== lvm

To build an image that uses LVM:

[source,toml]
----
[[customizations.disk.partitions]]
type = "lvm"
minsize = "1 GiB"
----

This will convert the partition that contains the root mountpoint `/` to an LVM Volume Group containing a root Logical Volume.
