== Partitioning

By default *Fedora Minimal* uses raw partitioning with an `ext4` root partition mounted at `/`. This can be changed in the following ways:

=== Mode

More information about how `image-builder` uses partitioning mode customizations can be found in the https://osbuild.org/docs/user-guide/partitioning/[upstream documentation].

==== btrfs

To build an image that uses btrfs:

[source,toml]
----
customizations.partitioning_mode = "btrfs"
----

This will convert the partition that contains the root mountpoint `/` to a btrfs volume containing a root subvolume.

==== lvm

To build an image that uses LVM:

[source,toml]
----
customizations.partitioning_mode = "lvm"
----

This will convert the partition that contains the root mountpoint `/` to an LVM Volume Group containing a root Logical Volume.
