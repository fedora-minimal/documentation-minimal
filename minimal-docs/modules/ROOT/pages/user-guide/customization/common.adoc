== Partitioning

By default *Fedora Minimal* uses raw partitioning with an `ext4` root partition mounted at `/`. This can be changed in the following ways:

=== btrfs

To build an image that uses btrfs you can use the following blueprint:

[source,toml]
----
[[customizations.disk.partitions]]
type = "btrfs"
minsize = "3 GiB"
subvolumes = [
  { name = "root", mountpoint = "/" },
]
----

=== lvm

To build an image that uses LVM:

[source,toml]
----
[[customizations.disk.partitions]]
type = "lvm"
minsize = "3 GiB"
----

This will convert the partition that contains the root mountpoint `/` to an LVM Volume Group containing a root Logical Volume.
