== Fedora 43

During this release we focused on minimizing the package set that is installed by default in *Fedora Minimal*.

- Disabled rescue kernel generation on boot. This was accidentally enabled again in one of the previous versions but turned off again in Fedora 43. See https://github.com/fedora-minimal/distribution-minimal/issues/10[discussion].
- Removed `firewalld` from the package set. See https://github.com/fedora-minimal/distribution-minimal/issues/1[discussion].


== Fedora 42

The *Fedora Minimal SIG* was created to outline better what *Fedora Minimal* is, its usecases, and its differences from other Fedora variants.

== Fedora 38

The *Fedora Minimal* aarch64 image became a https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/releases/f38/blocking/[Release Blocking] artifact.

== History

*Fedora Minimal* has been around in some way or shape since around Fedora 11 or 12. There are a few wiki pages around for the spin.
